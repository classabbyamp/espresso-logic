The original Espresso code comes from the 1989 Berkeley code (https://embedded.eecs.berkeley.edu/pubs/downloads/espresso/index.htm). See the COPYING file for original code license.

This distribution is just a C99 port of the excellent work made by Andrew to simplify and port to C89 standards (https://github.com/Rupan/espresso/tree/master/jni/espresso).
